Purpose of the Role:

The purpose of this role is to analyse, design and engineer innovative software solutions to projects aligned with the requirements of McLaren Racing.

Role Dimensions: 

The Software & Data Science department is responsible for the analysis, design, and delivery of bespoke software tools which ultimately help improve our Formula 1 car's performance. This starts with aerodynamicists submitting designs via the CFD Portal, through wind tunnel data acquisition, processing, and analysis, to simulation and car setup optimisation, to trackside operational decision-making tools such as race strategy. We are a cross-functional group, bringing together data science, machine learning, software engineering, and DevOps to create solutions for our customers' needs.

As a Senior Associate Software Engineer, you will be involved in all stages of the development life cycle from initial analysis right through to deployment, monitoring, and support. Due to the nature of track and tunnel operations, some flexibility to work out of office hours and weekends will be required. The role will be primarily based at the McLaren Technology Centre with a proportion of the time spent working from home.

Principal Accountabilities: 


To take and understand project requirements to define specifications and to architect robust, scalable and testable software and system solutions.
To be involved in all stages of the development life cycle: initial analysis, design, implementation, build, integration, testing, deployment, debugging and support.
To confidently analyse and overcome technical challenges with workable and innovative solutions.
To work collaboratively with the team to make sure that all aspects of the project are delivered as planned.
To raise awareness of and mitigate against potential technical risks.
To maintain consistent standards and approaches adopted by the team.
To accurately estimate activity timescales and provide regular progress reports.
To efficiently manage your workload.
To keep up to date with the latest software development technologies and methodologies.
To freely share knowledge, insight, best practice, and ideas.



Knowledge, Skills and Experience: 

Essential


BSc in Computer Science or equivalent discipline (2:1 or above) or equivalent industry experience. 
High proficiency with at least one backend language used in a commercial setting (ideally C#/.NET or Python).
Experience with frontend technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and CSS.
Experience using git in a collaborative environment (pull requests, feature branches).
Experience building maintainable codebases using the SOLID principles.
High competency in written and oral English language.



Desirable


Commercial experience working with agile/lean methodologies
Experience with Linux and running containers on Kubernetes.
Experience with SQL and document databases e.g. SQL Server and MongoDB.
Experience of multi-threaded application development.
Experience using cloud technologies e.g. Microsoft Azure.



Personal Attributes: 


Self-motivated with high levels of initiative. 
You enjoy working with people to solve problems, choosing the simplest and most elegant approach then iterating.
You're flexible and adaptable, detail orientated, and get satisfaction from delivering to a high standard.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. To learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.By providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's Applicant Privacy Notice, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

Results of the audit may be viewed here: CoveyAbout SevenRoomsIn 2011, Joel Montaniel, Allison Page, and Kinesh Patel founded SevenRooms after noticing that hospitality operators were missing a critical ingredient in the systems they were using to run their business: guest data. What began as a mission to help restaurants better understand and serve their guests evolved into a powerful platform used by merchants around the world.With best-in-class tools for marketing, operations, and guest experience — all deeply integrated with its industry-leading CRM — SevenRooms empowers operators to drive revenue, streamline operations, and deliver experiences that keep guests coming back.In 2025, DoorDash acquired SevenRooms to strengthen its in-store strategy and expand its merchant-first offerings. The combination brings together DoorDash's scale, reach, and digital innovation with SevenRooms' in-store capabilities to support hospitality businesses across every channel — from discovery and delivery to on-premise dining.As DoorDash builds out its in-store capabilities, SevenRooms plays a central role in enabling merchants to grow their businesses and connect more meaningfully with guests, whether they're ordering online or dining in. This move reflects DoorDash's broader commitment to empowering local businesses, fostering stronger connections between consumers and the places they love, and building technology that meets merchants — and their customers — wherever they are.",https://uk.linkedin.com/jobs/view/software-engineer-frontend-at-doordash-4296361945?position=3&pageNum=0&refId=GEPErpLf0xKjs6EXFjkCzQ%3D%3D&trackingId=ejNnryOI5f%2FcpCICZhNT7w%3D%3D,LinkedIn Scraper,2026-02-03T12:55:28.851483+00:00,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFbAtJ4Rl0SEg/company-logo_100_100/B4EZa2Dj_dHkAQ-/0/1746811109671/doordash_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=q4eFLFkMf8ZwKpDStPkbpPXMUgCjk54GVtkzdinIRq8,,,,,2026-02-06T21:39:01.473877+00:00,2026-02-06T21:39:01.473877+00:00,,,

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension).

If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources.

If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

The combination brings together DoorDash's scale, reach, and digital innovation with SevenRooms' in-store capabilities to support hospitality businesses across every channel — from discovery and delivery to on-premise dining.As DoorDash builds out its in-store capabilities, SevenRooms plays a central role in enabling merchants to grow their businesses and connect more meaningfully with guests, whether they're ordering online or dining in. This move reflects DoorDash's broader commitment to empowering local businesses, fostering stronger connections between consumers and the places they love, and building technology that meets merchants — and their customers — wherever they are.",https://uk.linkedin.com/jobs/view/software-engineer-frontend-at-doordash-4296361945?position=2&pageNum=0&refId=6gxiFT9l%2F3kPUYyvkpFKbw%3D%3D&trackingId=q90lsTptpv53o9OZ%2FQ30ig%3D%3D,LinkedIn Scraper,2026-02-04T01:48:44.673114+00:00,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQFbAtJ4Rl0SEg/company-logo_100_100/B4EZa2Dj_dHkAQ-/0/1746811109671/doordash_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=q4eFLFkMf8ZwKpDStPkbpPXMUgCjk54GVtkzdinIRq8,,,,,2026-02-06T21:39:01.473877+00:00,2026-02-06T21:39:01.473877+00:00,,,

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI.

That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension).

If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families.

We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

a1d997c7-73ab-403d-a76f-0a8000d17bb4,Associate Software Engineer - (Graduate),Encord,"London, England, United Kingdom","About EncordAt Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand our Engineering team to help us in building a better product for our customers.This is a full-time role starting in June or September 2026 depending on graduation dates.Who We Are Looking ForWe’re looking for curious, ambitious graduates who are excited to launch their software engineering careers and make an impact from day one. You’ll join us around June/September 2026 as part of a small, highly collaborative team that’s building the next generation of AI infrastructure.At Encord, you’ll work alongside serial founders, ex-computer scientists, physicists, and quants who care deeply about building great products and shipping fast.

We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension).

It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources.

If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. To learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.By providing your information, you acknowledge that you want Roku to contact you about job roles, that you have read Roku's Applicant Privacy Notice, and understand that Roku will use your information as described in that notice.

What began as a mission to help restaurants better understand and serve their guests evolved into a powerful platform used by merchants around the world.With best-in-class tools for marketing, operations, and guest experience — all deeply integrated with its industry-leading CRM — SevenRooms empowers operators to drive revenue, streamline operations, and deliver experiences that keep guests coming back.In 2025, DoorDash acquired SevenRooms to strengthen its in-store strategy and expand its merchant-first offerings. The combination brings together DoorDash's scale, reach, and digital innovation with SevenRooms' in-store capabilities to support hospitality businesses across every channel — from discovery and delivery to on-premise dining.As DoorDash builds out its in-store capabilities, SevenRooms plays a central role in enabling merchants to grow their businesses and connect more meaningfully with guests, whether they're ordering online or dining in.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning.

We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families.

If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension).

It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. Our mission is to be the TV streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. We connect consumers to the content they love, enable content publishers to build and monetize large audiences, and provide advertisers unique capabilities to engage consumers.From your first day at Roku, you'll make a valuable - and valued - contribution. We're a fast-growing public company where no one is a bystander. We offer you the opportunity to delight millions of TV streamers around the world while gaining meaningful experience across a variety of disciplines.  About the Team The Advanced Development team invents the next generation of intelligent, generative, and data-driven systems at Roku. We work ahead of production, building prototypes that evolve into the foundations of future Roku products - including LLM-powered analytics, internal automation platforms and creative tooling.  You’ll join a small, high-ownership team working across UI, AI-assisted workflows, data discovery, and internal developer tools. It’s a fast-paced, exploratory environment with a mandate to turn promising ideas into working software that delivers measurable value.  About the Role We’re looking for a front-end engineer to help build our next generation intelligent internal tools and data platforms. Your work will empower the organization to turn raw data into actionable intelligence through robust and secure internal tooling. In this role, you’ll design and build modern, responsive interfaces for internal applications that help teams retrieve, analyze, and visualize business data. You’ll work at the intersection of UX and AI, shaping how LLM-assisted systems present insights and recommendations to users in clear and trustworthy ways. Along the way, you’ll collaborate with experienced engineers and designers to build UI components for our internal tools ecosystem and translate complex backend logic into intuitive user experiences. What You’ll Be Doing Build Data-Rich Interfaces: Develop dashboards, charts, tables, and interactive visualizations that make large or complex datasets easy to interpret and act on. Design Human-Centered AI Interfaces: Create front-end workflows that integrate LLMs, chatbots, and AI-generated insights—ensuring transparency, clarity, and user trust. Develop Robust Front-End Architecture: Implement reusable components, internal UI libraries, and data-driven widgets that support analytics, decision-support tools, and workflow automation. Collaborate Across Disciplines: Work closely with backend, analytics, and design teams to translate complex logic, schemas, and business rules into clear, intuitive UI. End-to-End Delivery: Participate in rapid prototyping, user testing, iteration cycles, and front-end performance tuning. Design for Clarity & Trust: Implement thoughtful guardrails and explainability features that help users understand how data was calculated or why an insight was surfaced. Engineering Best Practices: Contribute to code reviews, architecture discussions, and UI/UX standards for internal tools.  We’re Excited if You Have 2–5 years of front-end engineering experience, with solid fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript, and hands-on experience with at least one modern framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. Experience building data-rich interfaces - including tables, charts, filters, and dashboard-style interactions - and familiarity with design systems or internal UI component libraries. Comfort working with SQL and understanding schemas, along with an interest in building tools that help non-technical users safely access and explore business data. Interest in AI-assisted UI design, including integrating LLMs, prompts, or agent-generated insights into product workflows—or eagerness to learn. Experience consuming REST APIs or internal services and translating backend logic into clean, understandable UI. Ability to prototype quickly and iterate based on feedback, turning user or analytical needs into polished front-end solutions. Familiarity with data tools or visualization libraries such as D3, Chart.js, Recharts, or similar technologies. A product-minded approach, comfortable turning ambiguous problem statements into coherent solutions and collaborating across backend engineering, UX, analytics, and product teams. Ability to thrive in fast-paced, exploratory environments where prototypes evolve quickly and requirements shift as we learn from users and the system.   Our Hybrid Work ApproachRoku fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment where teams work in the office Monday through Thursday. Fridays are flexible for remote work except for employees whose roles are required to be in the office five days a week or employees who are in offices with a five day in office policy. BenefitsRoku is committed to offering a diverse range of benefits as part of our compensation package to support our employees and their families. Our comprehensive benefits include global access to mental health and financial wellness support and resources. Local benefits include statutory and voluntary benefits which may include healthcare (medical, dental, and vision), life, accident, disability, commuter, and retirement options (401(k)/pension). Our employees can take time off work for vacation and other personal reasons to balance their evolving work and life needs. It's important to note that not every benefit is available in all locations or for every role. For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter. AccommodationsRoku welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and provides reasonable accommodations and adjustments in accordance with applicable law. If you require reasonable accommodation at any point in the hiring process, please direct your inquiries to EmployeeRelations@Roku.com. The Roku CultureRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer.

The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time-consuming. We’re here to change that.As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in our space.

Your contributions here will have a real, visible impact.If you’re finishing university and looking for your first full-time engineering role where you can learn fast, build meaningful products, and grow alongside an exceptional team, Encord could be the perfect place for you.What To Expect High performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market.
